# Boyfriend Bot
I released this as I requested that all of my code was removed from boyfriend bot's SRC, however it wasn't... So, here we are now!

## How to use this!
  Download the repository and open a CMD/Terminal in the directory of the folder.
  Make sure you make a file called `.env`, check [example.env](example.env) to see an example
  Then, run `npm install`.
  After that, you should just be able to run `npm run dev` then you the bot should function as normal.
